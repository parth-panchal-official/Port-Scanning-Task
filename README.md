# Task 1: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports

üìå Objective
The goal of this task is to perform a port scan on my local network to identify active hosts and detect open ports.  
This helps understand how network reconnaissance works and why securing open ports is important in network security.

# üõ† Tools Used
- **Operating System:** Kali Linux  
- **Port Scanning Tool:** Nmap (7.94SVN)  
- **Packet Analyzer:** Wireshark (optional, not used in this scan)

---

# üìù Steps Performed

# 1. Identify Network Information
- Opened a terminal in Kali Linux.  
- Ran the following command to check my IP address and subnet mask:

  bash :- ifconfig

* Results:

  * IP Address: `10.137.128.110`
  * Netmask: `255.255.255.0`
  * Network Range: `10.137.128.0/24`

---

# 2. Perform Nmap TCP SYN Scan

* Executed the following command to perform a TCP SYN scan on my local network:

 ```bash
  nmap -sS 10.137.128.0/24
  ```
* The `-sS` option performs a stealth SYN scan, which is widely used for reconnaissance.
---

# 3. Save Scan Results

* Saved the scan results in a text file using:

  ```bash
  nmap -sS 10.137.128.0/24 -oN scan_results.txt
  
* This created a file named **scan\_results.txt** for documentation.

# 4. Analyze Results

* Found **2 active hosts** in my local network:

  * **10.137.128.110** ‚Üí My Kali Linux machine
  * **10.137.128.134** ‚Üí Another device (Intel Corporate MAC)
    
* Observed that:

  * No top 1000 TCP ports were open.
  * All ports were either filtered or closed, indicating firewall protection.

### Scan Results File

* Text file with detailed results: [scan\_results.txt](scan_results.txt)

## ‚úÖ Outcome

* Successfully performed a TCP SYN port scan using Nmap on Kali Linux.
* Detected **2 live hosts** in my local network.
* Observed that no common ports were open, likely due to firewall filtering.
* Gained practical understanding of:

  * Port scanning
  * Network reconnaissance
  * How firewalls protect open ports
  * Why monitoring with tools like Wireshark is valuable
